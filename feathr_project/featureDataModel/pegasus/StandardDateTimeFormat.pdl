 * Represents the standard DateTimeFormat used across LinkedIn, ie. yyyy/MM/dd for daily datasets and yyyy/MM/dd/hh for hourly datasets. The convention is widely adopted, for example, storing tracking data under /data/tracking/ on HDFS. TODO(PROML-12707): This data model is expected to be deprecated when the dev work and migration of "Unification of SWA and time-based features" is completed (RFC: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6u2CKWSmOmHDQEL8Ovm5V5ZZFKhC_HdxVxU9D1F9lg/edit#).
